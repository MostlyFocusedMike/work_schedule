# work_schedule
A simple command line Python program that tracks my work schedule and calculates my paycheck. 

PROJECT GOALS:
-Work in the command line since that's what my app used 
-Be able to save/edit/export work schedules from various pay periods
-Use classes and functions properly
-Incorporate error handling

PROJECT NOTES: 
This was one of my first "big" programs I wrote once I learned Python. I need a program that would work on my
phone's Python app (Pythonista, for the curious) that would let me track my hours and estimate my paycheck. I had
been using spreadsheets before, but I kept forgetting once I was home. I needed an easy way to do it on my phone.
I think it came out really well and honestly, I still use it to this day. Definitely my first taste of solving real
problems with coding.
